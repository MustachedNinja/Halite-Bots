Improvements:
Add a function that keeps ships from crashing into each other
When the nearest planet is captured by an enemy, attack the enemy first instead of finding an empty planet


Potential new bot ideas:
a predetermined percentage of bots are designated attacking bots while the other are mining
something like a 40-attack and 60-mining split
Possible improvement: first couple turns the bots are 100% mining and as time goes on
Possible improvement: if the number of ships falls below a given number, convert more of them to mining
